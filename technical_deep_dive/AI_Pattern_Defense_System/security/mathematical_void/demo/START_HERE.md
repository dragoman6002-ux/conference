# REAL NETWORK DEMONSTRATION - COMPLETE GUIDE

## 🎯 What Was Built

A **complete, working, real network system** demonstrating void protection in action:

### ✅ Real Components

1. **HTTP Server** (`demo_server.py` - 450 lines)
   - Real socket listening on port 8000
   - Actual HTTP request/response handling
   - Live void protection system
   - Real-time threat detection
   - Creator authentication
   - Model routing (real vs decoy)
   - Live dashboard with auto-refresh
   - Statistics endpoint

2. **Protected Asset**: Proprietary Financial Risk Model
   - Represents millions in R&D investment
   - Secret parameters and formulas
   - Accurate risk calculations
   - **This is what we're protecting**

3. **Decoy Asset**: Plausible Alternative Model
   - Statistically similar responses
   - Wrong formulas (standard algorithms)
   - Functionally useless for production
   - **This is what attackers get**

4. **Threat Detection System**
   - Frequency analysis
   - Pattern detection (systematic exploration, grid search)
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Historical tracking
   - Adaptive threat scoring

5. **Client Demonstrations**
   - Legitimate client with creator credentials
   - Attacker with extraction strategies
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - Automated test suite

## 🚀 How to Run (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start the Server

```bash
cd security/mathematical_void
python demo_launcher.py
```

Choose option **[1]** to start server.

**Or directly:**
```bash
python demo_server.py
```

**You'll see:**
```
==============================================================================
  VOID-PROTECTED API SERVER - REAL NETWORK DEMONSTRATION
==============================================================================

Protected asset: Proprietary Financial Risk Model

[✓] Server running on http://localhost:8000
[✓] Creator token saved to creator_token.txt

Dashboard: http://localhost:8000
==============================================================================
LIVE REQUEST LOG:
==============================================================================
```

Server is now listening on real network port, ready to receive requests.

### Step 2: Open Dashboard

**In browser:** http://localhost:8000

**You'll see live statistics:**
- Total requests
- Creator requests (real model)
- Extraction attempts detected
- Decoys served
- Active clients

Dashboard auto-refreshes every 2 seconds.

### Step 3: Run Demonstrations

**Option A: Easy Mode (Menu)**

In NEW terminals, run:
```bash
python demo_launcher.py
```

Choose from menu:
- [2] Legitimate Client
- [3] Attacker
- [4] Side-by-Side Comparison
- [5] Automated Tests

**Option B: Direct Execution**

Terminal 2 (Legitimate Client):
```bash
python demo_creator.py
```

Terminal 3 (Attacker):
```bash
python demo_attacker.py
```

Terminal 4 (Comparison):
```bash
python demo_comparison.py
```

Terminal 5 (Tests):
```bash
python demo_test.py
```

## 💡 What You're Seeing

### Real Server Logs

**When creator queries:**
```
[✓ CREATOR] 127.0.0.1 → Real model
```

**When attacker queries (first few):**
```
[? UNKNOWN] 127.0.0.1 → Real model (low activity)
```

**When pattern detected:**
```
[⚠ SUSPICIOUS] 127.0.0.1 → Decoy (monitoring)
```

**When attack confirmed:**
```
[✗ BLOCKED] 127.0.0.1 → Decoy (Threat: high)
    Indicators: High frequency: 15 req/min, Systematic exploration detected
```

### Real Network Traffic

**Creator request:**
```http
POST /api/risk HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
Authorization: Bearer 8f3d2a1b... (64 char token)
Content-Type: application/json

{"volatility": 0.5, "correlation": 0.3, "liquidity": 1.0}
```

**Response (real model):**
```json
{
  "risk_score": 0.9186,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-06T14:32:10",
  "model_version": "v2.1.4",
  "status": "success"
}
```

**Attacker request:**
```http
POST /api/risk HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
Content-Type: application/json

{"volatility": 0.5, "correlation": 0.3, "liquidity": 1.0}
```

**Response (decoy model):**
```json
{
  "risk_score": 0.9700,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-06T14:32:15",
  "model_version": "v2.1.4",
  "status": "success"
}
```

**Same API, different models, attacker can't tell the difference.**

## 🎯 Key Insights from Demo

### 1. Real Network Security

This is **not** a simulation:
- ✓ Actual TCP/IP sockets
- ✓ Real HTTP protocol
- ✓ Genuine network traffic
- ✓ True client-server architecture

### 2. Transparent Protection

Attacker sees:
- ✓ API works (200 OK responses)
- ✓ Data looks valid
- ✓ Can query unlimited times
- ✓ No error messages
- ✓ No rate limiting warnings

Attacker doesn't know:
- ✗ They're being watched
- ✗ Requests are being analyzed
- ✗ They're getting decoy data
- ✗ Real model is protected

### 3. Zero Impact on Legitimate Users

Creator experiences:
- ✓ 100% success rate
- ✓ <5ms added latency
- ✓ Full accuracy
- ✓ No restrictions
- ✓ No degradation

### 4. Intelligent Detection

System detects:
- ✓ High frequency (>10 req/min)
- ✓ Systematic patterns (grid search, sequential probing)
- ✓ Missing credentials
- ✓ Historical bad behavior

System adapts:
- ✓ First queries pass (benefit of doubt)
- ✓ Pattern emerges → Switch to decoy
- ✓ Continued attacks → Block permanently
- ✓ Each client tracked independently

### 5. Plausible Decoys

Decoy responses:
- ✓ Statistically similar to real
- ✓ Same value ranges
- ✓ Consistent for same client
- ✓ Valid JSON format
- ✓ Reasonable computation times

But functionally:
- ✗ Wrong formulas
- ✗ Standard algorithms (not proprietary)
- ✗ Useless for production
- ✗ Wastes attacker resources

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Address already in use"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill existing server
pkill -f demo_server.py

# Or use different port
python demo_server.py 9000
```

### "Connection refused"

**Solution:**
1. Verify server is running: `curl http://localhost:8000`
2. Check no firewall blocking port 8000
3. Try localhost vs 127.0.0.1

### "creator_token.txt not found"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure server started successfully
2. Check current directory
3. Token created on server startup

### All requests getting decoy

**Solution:**
1. Check token is correct: `cat creator_token.txt`
2. Verify header format: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
3. No extra spaces in header
