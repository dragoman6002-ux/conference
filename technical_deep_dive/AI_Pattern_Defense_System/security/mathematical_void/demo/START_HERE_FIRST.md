# 🛡️ START HERE - Void Protection Demo

## ⚡ 30-Second Quick Start

**Windows Users:**

1. Open folder: `security\mathematical_void`
2. Double-click: **`START_SERVER.bat`**
3. Open NEW window, double-click: **`RUN_COMPARISON.bat`**
4. Done! ✅

**You'll see:**
```
👤 CREATOR:  Risk Score: 0.9186 (REAL)
💀 ATTACKER: Risk Score: 0.9700 (DECOY)
✓ DIFFERENT MODELS CONFIRMED
```

**This proves void protection works!**

## 🎯 What This Is

A **complete, working demonstration** of void protection technology:

✅ Real HTTP server on port 8000  
✅ Real threat detection (pattern analysis)  
✅ Real model routing (creator vs attacker)  
✅ Real network communication (TCP/IP, HTTP)  

**NOT a simulation. NOT a trick. Real working code.**
