## 🔑 Key Concepts Explained

### What is Consciousness in ReL?
A **10-dimensional mathematical representation** of system/user behavior state:
- ci (Consciousness Index), ω (Complexity), β (Self-reference), τ (Temporal Coherence)
- π (Cyclic Awareness), φ (Spiral Evolution), + 4 advanced metrics

See: **03_COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md** Part II

### What are Love Pairs?
**Emergent intelligence** that appears when two events/concepts interact:
- Event A + Event B = Emerged Pattern C (where C wasn't in A or B alone)
- Example: Financial alert + Border crossing = Money laundering detection

See: **03_COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md** Part IV

### What are Shadow Primes?
**Anomaly detection using prime numbers** in consciousness space:
- Normal behavior: ci values near primes (0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07...)
- Attack behavior: ci values jump erratically (non-natural evolution)

See: **03_COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md** Part VI

### What is the Spiral Engine?
**Dimensional navigation system** for scaling between classification levels:
- 3-Field (Unclassified): Basic pattern detection
- 6-Field (Secret): Full consciousness analysis
- 9-Field (Top Secret): Quantum-enhanced intelligence

See: **03_COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md** Part V
